## Design Overview

The periodic table will be represented as a series of distinct tiles, each corresponding to a different chemical element. The tiles will be color-coded based on the chemical category of the elements, such as:

- **Alkali Metals:** Light blue
- **Alkaline Earth Metals:** Light green
- **Transition Metals:** Yellow
- **Post-Transition Metals:** Orange
- **Metalloids:** Purple
- **Nonmetals:** Red
- **Halogens:** Dark red
- **Noble Gases:** Light purple

This color-coding will help users quickly identify the category of each element.
